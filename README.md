Cryptocurrency Portfolio Proposal
Background
In this challenge, you will take on the role of an advisor in a leading financial advisory firm. Your task is to propose a novel approach to assembling investment portfolios based on cryptocurrencies. Instead of relying solely on returns and volatility, you aim to incorporate additional factors that could influence the cryptocurrency market, ultimately leading to better portfolio performance.

Your innovative proposal has been well-received by your manager, and you've been tasked with creating a prototype for presenting your cryptocurrency portfolio strategy to the company's board of directors.

What You're Creating
In this project, you will leverage your financial Python programming skills and the unsupervised learning techniques you've acquired in this module. Your objective is to develop a Jupyter notebook that clusters cryptocurrencies based on their performance over different time periods. Subsequently, you will visualize the clustering results to effectively communicate the performance to the board.

Data Source
The data for this project is provided in a CSV file, which contains price change information for various cryptocurrencies across different time periods. This dataset will serve as the foundation for your analysis and clustering.

Key Steps
Data Preparation: Load and preprocess the provided cryptocurrency price change data.
Feature Engineering: Create relevant features and metrics for clustering.
Unsupervised Learning: Apply clustering algorithms to group cryptocurrencies based on their performance.
Data Visualization: Visualize the clustering results to convey the portfolio's performance effectively.
Dependencies
Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
jupyter notebook
Getting Started
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
